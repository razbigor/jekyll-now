**No Enemies**  
by Charles Mackay  

YOU have no enemies, you say?  
Alas! my friend, the boast is poor;  
He who has mingled in the fray  
Of duty, that the brave endure,  
Must have made foes! If you have none,  
Small is the work that you have done.  
You've hit no traitor on the hip,  
You've dashed no cup from perjured lip,  
You've never turned the wrong to right,  
You've been a coward in the fight.  

**Social order at the expense of liberty is hardly a bargain**

"_The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear._"
â€“ Antonio Gramsci
