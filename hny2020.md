TO THE WAVERER  

You say:  
Things are going badly for our cause.  
The darkness grows. Our powers decline.  
Now, after toiling for so many years  
We are in a worse position than at the beginning.  
  
But our enemy is stronger than ever.  
His powers, it seems, have grown. He begins to look invincible.  
Oh we have made mistakes, thereâ€™s no denying it.  
Our numbers dwindle rapidly.  
Our precepts are in confusion. Some of our words  
Have been twisted by the enemy beyond recognition.  
  
What is now false of what we once said  
Some of it or all of it?  
On whom can we still rely? Are we who remain just flotsam, thrown  
Out of the living stream? Will we live on  
Understanding nobody and understood by none?  
Is it luck that we need?  
  
So you ask. Expect  
No other answer than your own!
