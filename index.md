I mainly work with the moving image, occasionally I write. My work has been shown at BFI Southbank, Glasgow’s CCA, Nottingham Contemporary and Vienna’s Kunsthalle Exnergasse. I hold a BA in _Contemporary Media Practice_ from the University of Westminster and an MA in _Research Architecture_ from Goldsmiths College. I have lectured on Experimental Film and Video at the University of Westminster and on Urban Practices at University College London. In the past decade I have been active in trade union and housing struggles. 

I am currently working on [Where Were You In 1992?](http://1992.maydayrooms.org/), [The Flower Beneath The Foot](https://theflowerbeneaththefoot.com/), [Trade Unionists for Housing](https://twitter.com/tuforhousing), [Activist Media Project](https://amp.0x2620.org/) and Rebel Tango - a queer, Argentine tango skillshare.
