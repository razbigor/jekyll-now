My work is collaborative and I mainly work with the moving image. I currently divide my time between _[Where Were You In 1992?](http://1992.maydayrooms.org/), [The Flower Beneath The Foot](https://theflowerbeneaththefoot.com/), [Activist Media Project](https://amp.0x2620.org/)_ and _[Rebel Tango](https://www.rastko.co.uk/rebeltango/)_.
