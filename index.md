My work is collaborative and I mainly work with the moving image. I currently divide my time between _[Where Were You In 1992?](http://1992.maydayrooms.org/), [The Flower Beneath The Foot](https://theflowerbeneaththefoot.com/), [Activist Media Project](https://amp.0x2620.org/)_ and _[Rebel Tango](http://thefieldnx.com/calendar/)_.

I hold a BA in _Contemporary Media Practice_ from the University of Westminster, an MA in _Research Architecture_ from Goldsmiths College and a Diploma in _Employment Law_ from the Workers' Educational Association. I have lectured on Experimental Film and Video at the University of Westminster and on Urban Practices at University College London. In the past decade I have been active in trade union and housing struggles.
