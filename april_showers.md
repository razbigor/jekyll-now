A film exploring the everyday life of a London student guerilla group who call themselves **Immediate Global Justice**. Revolutionary rhetoric is mixed with boredom and house chores. Interviews with scholars question the motivation and the exact nature of the groupâ€™s activities. 

April Showers was made possible through a Leverhulme Trust artist-in-residence grant at UCL's School of Slavonic and East European Studies. This enabled a group of staff and students to explore issues of 'student radicalisation' and the unresolved legacy of the wars in Yugoslavia through making a film together.
