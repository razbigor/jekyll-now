Death  

(Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953)

Where was the body found?  
Who found the dead body?  
Was the dead body dead when found?  
How was the dead body found?  
  
Who was the dead body?  

Who was the father or daughter or brother  
Or uncle or sister or mother or son  
Of the dead and abandoned body?  
 
Was the body dead when abandoned?  
Was the body abandoned?  
By whom had it been abandoned?  
  
Was the dead body naked or dressed for a journey?  

What made you declare the dead body dead?  
Did you declare the dead body dead?  
How well did you know the dead body?  
How did you know the body was dead?  
 
Did you wash the dead body  
Did you close both its eyes  
Did you bury the body  
Did you leave it abandoned  
Did you kiss the dead body  
 
Harold Pinter, 1997
