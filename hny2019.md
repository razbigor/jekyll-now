DEATH (Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1953)  
 
Where was the body found?  
Who found the dead body?  
Was the dead body dead when found?  
How was the dead body found?  
  
Who was the dead body?  

Who was the father or daughter or brother  
Or uncle or sister or mother or son  
Of the dead and abandoned body?  
 
Was the body dead when abandoned?  
Was the body abandoned?  
By whom had it been abandoned?  
  
Was the dead body naked or dressed for a journey?  

What made you declare the dead body dead?  
Did you declare the dead body dead?  
How well did you know the dead body?  
How did you know the body was dead?  
 
Did you wash the dead body  
Did you close both its eyes  
Did you bury the body  
Did you leave it abandoned  
Did you kiss the dead body  
 
**Harold Pinter, 1997**

IF ONLY OUT OF VANITY  

If only out of vanity  
I have wondered what kind of woman I will be  
when I am well past the summer of my raging youth  
Will I still be raising revolutionary flags  
and making impassioned speeches  
that stir up anger in the hearts of pseudo-liberals  
dressed in navy-blue conservative wear  
  
In those years when I am grateful  
I still have a good sturdy bladder  
that does not leak undigested prune juice  
onto diapers—no longer adorable  
will I be more grateful for that  
than for any forward movement in any current political cause   
and will it have been worth it then  
Will it have been worth the long hours  
of not sleeping  
that produced little more than reams  
of badly written verses that catapulted me into literary spasms  
but did not even whet the appetite  
of the three O’ clock crowd  
in the least respected of the New York poetry cafes  
  
Will I wish then that I had taken that job working at the bank  
or the one to watch that old lady drool  
all over her soft boiled eggs  
as she tells me how she was a raving beauty in the sixties  
how she could have had any man she wanted  
but she chose the one least likely to succeed  
and that’s why when the son of a bitch died  
she had to move into this place  
because it was government subsidized  
  
Will I tell my young attendant  
how slender I was then  
and paint for her pictures  
of the young me more beautiful than I ever was  
if only to make her forget the shriveled paper skin  
the stained but even dental plates  
and the faint smell of urine that tends to linger  
in places built especially for revolutionaries  
whose causes have been won  
or forgotten  
  
Will I still be lesbian then  
or will the church or family finally convince me  
to marry some man with a smaller dick  
than the one my woman uses to afford me  
violent and multiple orgasms  
  
Will the staff smile at me  
humor my eccentricities to my face  
but laugh at me in their private resting rooms  
saying she must have been something in her day  
  
Most days I don’t know what I will be like then  
but everyday—I know what I want to be now  
I want to be that voice that makes Guilani  
so scared he hires two (butch) black bodyguards  
  
I want to write the poem  
that The New York Times cannot print  
because it might start some kind of black or lesbian  
or even a white revolution  
  
I want to go to secret meetings and under the guise  
of female friendship I want to bed the women  
of those young and eager revolutionaries  
with too much zeal for their cause  
and too little passion for the women  
who follow them from city to city  
all the while waiting in separate rooms  
  
I want to be forty years old  
and weigh three hundred pounds   
and ride a motorcycle in the wintertime  
with four hell raising children  
and a one hundred ten pound female lover  
who writes poetry about my life  
and my children and loves me  
like no one has ever loved me before  
  
I want to be the girl your parents will use  
as a bad example of a lady  
  
I want to be the dyke who likes to fuck men   
  
I want to be the politician who never lies  
  
I want to be the girl who never cries  
  
I want to go down in history  
in a chapter marked miscellaneous  
because the writers could find  
no other way to categorize me  
In this world where classification is key  
I want to erase the straight lines  
So I can be me

KOLIKO JE JEDAN?  
  
Kol'ko je trideset osam puta šes'?  
A kol'ko je trideset pet puta pet?  
Kol'ko je trideset osam puta šes', gospođo?  
  
I ako ne znaš koliko je trideset osam puta šest,  
a ne znaš ni koliko je trideset pet puta pet,  
morao bi znat' da je trideset osam puta šest,  
veće nego trideset pet puta pet,  
inače ti džabe računica.  

Kol'ko je jedan posto kamate mesečno na godišnjem nivou?  
Ako misliš da je to dvanaest posto...  
(Meni je jedna cura kad sam bio mlad rekla:  
"Ne šišam te dva posto!"  
Međutim, posle jedno dvadeset godina,  
to vam izađe na sto posto,  
pa vi sad vidite šta vam je procentni račun.)  

Koliko je dva i dva?  
Ako ne znaš da je to pet!  
Ako ne znaš da je to šest!  
Ako ne znaš da je to trideset šest!  
Ako ne znaš da je to tri 'iljade četristo trideset šest!  
Ako ne znaš da je to četiri miliona četristo pedeset šest 'iljada dvesto trideset šest!  
Na Švajcarski račun!  
Pa još svaki mesec osamsto 'iljada!  
Nemoj da se kandiduješ.    
    
Nauka je zadnjih dve 'iljade godina mnogo napredovala,  
ali niko još nije odgovorio na pitanje:  
koliko je jedan?  
Jel' to malo?  
Jel' to mnogo?  
Gospođice, jel' jedan malo?  
Druže, jel' jedan mnogo?  
Koliko je jedan?

And it's old and old it's sad and old it's sad and weary I go back to you, my cold father, my cold mad father, my cold mad feary father, till the near sight of the mere size of him, the moyles and moyles of it, moananoaning, makes me	seasilt saltsick and I rush, my only, into your arms. I see them	rising! Save me from those therrble prongs! Two more. Onetwo	moremens more. So. Avelaval. My leaves have drifted from me.	All. But one clings still. I'll bear it on me. To remind me of. Lff!	So soft this morning, ours. Yes. Carry me along, taddy, like you	done through the toy fair!
