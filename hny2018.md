ZA NESHVAĆENE  

Tražim pomilovanje  
za neshvaćene  
koji ne umeju da premoste  
ni kapilarskih razdaljina  
do majke i sina,  
do svakodnevne stvari proste;  
za one koji ostaju strani  
rukama što ih drže u naručju,  
suncu pred kojim se sve razdani,  
sobnoj, kao košulja bliskoj, tami.  

Za sopstvene duše tamničare,   
za radosti svojih trovače,  
za one što viču kad im se plače,  
kad u nežnosti greznu,  
što uhode sebe kao tuđina,  
za puškarnice srca njina,  
za svačiju dušu zatvorenu  
i opreznu.   
  
  
Desanka Maksimović, 1964

FOR EACH OF YOU  

Be who you are and will be  
learn to cherish   
that boisterous Black Angel that drives you  
up one day and down another  
protecting the place where your power rises  
running like hot blood 
from the same source   
as your pain.  
  
When you are hungry  
learn to eat  
whatever sustains you  
until morning  
but do not be misled by details  
simply because you live them.  
  
Do not let your head deny  
your hands  
any memory of what passes through them  
not your eyes  
nor your heart  
everything can be used  
except what is wasteful  
(you will need  
to remember this when you are accused of destruction.)  
Even when they are dangerous examine the heart of those machines you hate  
before you discard them  
and never mourn the lack of their power  
lest you be condemened  
to relieve them.  
If you do not learn to hate  
you will never be lonely  
enough  
to love easily  
nor will you always be brave  
although it does not grow any easier.  
  
Do not pretend to convenient beliefs  
even when they are righteous  
you will never be able to defend your city  
while shouting.  
  
Remember whatever pain you bring back   
from your dreaming  
but do not look for new gods  
in the sea  
nor in any part of a rainbow  
Each time you love  
love as deeply as if were  
forever  
only nothing is  
eternal.  
  
Speak proudly to your children  
where ever you may find them  
tell them  
you are offspring of slaves  
and your mother was  
a princess  
in darkness.  
  
  
Audre Lorde, 1968
